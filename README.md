# Description 
The program displays a portfolio of my project highlights in web development. It satisfies the following requirements: 

1.  Upon loading the portfolio, the user is presented with the  developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

2. The navigation links connect to its corresponding section. 

3. The work section displays titled images of the developer's projects. 

4. Upon clicking the image (in the work section), the user is directed to the image's corresponging application image. 

5. When resizing the page, it adapts to the user's viewpoint. 

6. Mobile-first design

7. In the About Me section, a pdf link to my resume is also displayed.


# Structure 
Each section of the portfolio has an assigned class to a specific grid area on the page. <br> 
Using a grid strengthens the flexibility of the portfolio. To be sure, it simplifies revising and stylizing the program.  <br>
<br> 
Mobile-first design
Every section and associated information is displayed in rows to adhere to mobile 
frame restrictions and design.
